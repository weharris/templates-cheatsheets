# Title of Project

## 1. Background & Objectives

### 1.1 Background

Brief description of the scientific or practical problem motivating the analysis, including why this analysis is being undertaken and any important constraints (e.g. observational data, fixed sample size).

### 1.2 Objectives

Clearly state the analysis objectives.

- Primary objective(s): 1, 2, 3, ...
- Secondary / exploratory objective(s): 1, 2, 3, ...

## 2. Data and Statistical Methods

### 2.1 Data sources and structure

Data source(s) and how data were generated

- Independent **unit(s) of analysis**
- Expected **effect size** and justification of **Sample size** (planned or fixed)
- **Experimental design** (if relevant), **sampling design** (e.g. groups, time, space, plots, fields, etc.)

### 2.2 Variables

Description of variables, such as Identifying:

- Dependent variable(s)	
- Key predictors / exposures	
- Covariates / confounders	
- Grouping / random effects	

### 2.3 Data handling and quality control

- Inclusion and exclusion criteria
- Missing data approach
- Outliers and data validation
- Transformations or derived variables

### 2.4 Statistical analysis strategy

Overall analytical approach, including:

- Exploratory vs confirmatory emphasis
- Modelling philosophy (explanatory, predictive, parsimonious)
- Statistical framework (e.g. frequentist, Bayesian)

### 2.5 Primary analysis

For each primary objective:

- **Statistical model**(s) to be used
- **Key predictors** and adjustments
- **Assumptions** to be assessed
- Estimands or contrasts of interest

### 2.6 Secondary and sensitivity analyses

- Alternative model specifications
- Subgroup or stratified analyses
- Robustness checks or sensitivity analyses
- Multiple testing considerations (if relevant)

## 3. Outputs, Interpretation & Reporting

### 3.1 Planned outputs

- Tables (e.g. model estimates, uncertainty)
- Figures (e.g. effect plots, diagnostics)
- Summary statistics

### 3.2 Interpretation principles

- Emphasis on effect sizes and uncertainty
- Scientific or practical relevance
- Limitations and caveats (e.g. causal interpretation)

## 4. Reproducibility & Amendments

- Software and versions
- Reproducibility approach (scripts, notebooks, version control)
- Criteria for deviations from this plan and how they will be documented

### Optional sign-off (as required)
