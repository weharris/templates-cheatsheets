## Title: Your project title

## Background & Objectives

### Background

Brief description of the scientific or practical problem motivating the analysis, including why this analysis is being undertaken and any important constraints (e.g. observational data, fixed sample size).

### Objectives

Clearly state the analysis objectives.

- Primary objective(s): 1, 2, 3, ...
- Secondary / exploratory objective(s): 1, 2, 3, ...

## Data and Statistical Methods

### Data sources and structure

Data source(s) and how data were generated

- Independent **unit(s) of analysis**
- Expected **effect size** and justification of **Sample size** (planned or fixed)
- **Experimental design** (if relevant), **sampling design** (e.g. groups, time, space, plots, fields, etc.)

### Variables

Description of variables, such as Identifying:

- Dependent variable(s)
- Key predictors / exposures
- Covariates / confounders
- Grouping / random effects

### Data handling and quality control

- Inclusion and exclusion criteria
- Missing data approach
- Outliers and data validation
- Transformations or derived variables

### Statistical analysis strategy

Overall analytical approach, including:

- Exploratory vs confirmatory emphasis
- Modelling philosophy (explanatory, predictive, parsimonious)
- Statistical framework (e.g. frequentist, Bayesian)

### Primary analysis

- **Statistical model**(s) to be used
- **Key predictors** and adjustments
- **Assumptions** to be assessed
- Estimands or contrasts of interest

### Secondary and sensitivity analyses

- Alternative model specifications
- Subgroup or stratified analyses
- Robustness checks or sensitivity analyses
- Multiple testing considerations (if relevant)

## Outputs, Interpretation & Reporting

### Planned outputs

- Tables (e.g. model estimates, uncertainty)
- Figures (e.g. effect plots, diagnostics)
- Summary statistics

### Interpretation principles

- Emphasis on effect sizes and uncertainty
- Scientific or practical relevance
- Limitations and caveats (e.g. causal interpretation)

## Reproducibility & Amendments

- Software and versions
- Reproducibility approach (scripts, notebooks, version control)
- Criteria for deviations from this plan and how they will be documented

### Optional sign-off (as required)

- Researcher:
- Statistical consultant:
